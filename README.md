# 🌙 Arabic Support for Unity - Enhanced Edition

> *Making Arabic text in Unity as smooth as butter... or should I say, as smooth as زبدة?* 🧈

A friendly fork of [Konash's Arabic Support](https://github.com/Konash/arabic-support-unity) with extra goodies for TextMeshPro lovers! ✨

## 💝 What's This All About?

Arabic text can be tricky in Unity - it reads right-to-left, letters connect in fancy ways, and sometimes things just look... backwards. This enhanced version takes the original Arabic Support library and wraps it in a cozy blanket of TextMeshPro goodness!

## ✨ What Makes This Fork Special?

### 🎯 Auto-Magic TextMeshPro Integration
- **Drop and forget!** Just add a TMP_Text component and boom - Arabic support automatically attaches itself
- No more manual setup for every single text object (your wrists will thank you!)

### 🔄 Smart Processing Modes
Choose your adventure:
- **Once At Awake**: Set it and forget it! Perfect for static text
- **Real-Time Detection**: Watches your text like a hawk 🦅 and fixes it automatically
- **On Demand Only**: For when you like to be in control (we respect that!)

### ⌨️ Typing Effect Friendly
Got a cool typing animation? No problem!
```csharp
handler.StartTypingEffect();
// Do your typing magic here...
handler.EndTypingEffect(); // Auto-processes when done!
```

### 🛡️ Better Error Handling
- Safe character-by-character processing if something goes wrong
- Detailed error logging (because we care about you knowing what happened)
- Won't crash your game if it encounters a grumpy Unicode character

### 🎮 Edit Mode Preview
See your Arabic text correctly formatted right in the Unity Editor - no need to hit play!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
- Import the original Arabic Support package (we're standing on the shoulders of giants here!)
   OR
- Add these three scripts to your project:
   - `ArabicSupport.cs` (if not already there)
   - `ArabicTextHandler.cs`
   - `TMP_AutoAttach.cs`

### Basic Usage

**The Lazy Way (Recommended!)** 😴
1. Add a TextMeshPro component to your GameObject
2. Done! The `ArabicTextHandler` attaches itself automatically
3. Type some Arabic text
4. Watch the magic happen! ✨

**The Control Freak Way** 🎮
```csharp
ArabicTextHandler handler = GetComponent<ArabicTextHandler>();
handler.processingMode = ProcessingMode.OnDemandOnly;
handler.textComponent.text = "مرحبا بالعالم";
handler.ForceProcessText();
```

**For Typing Effects** ⌨️
```csharp
handler.StartTypingEffect();
foreach (char c in arabicText)
{
    handler.SetTextWithoutProcessing(currentText + c);
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.05f);
}
handler.EndTypingEffect();
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### In The Inspector
- **Processing Mode**: When to fix that Arabic text
- **Show Tashkeel**: Keep those beautiful diacritical marks (◍•ᴗ•◍)
- **Use Hindu Numbers**: ٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩ instead of 0123456789
- **Startup Delay**: Give your scene a moment to breathe before processing
- **Error Handling**: Skip problematic characters or let exceptions fly

### Programmatic Control
```csharp
// Pause processing during sensitive operations
handler.pauseProcessing = true;

// Change modes on the fly
handler.SetProcessingMode(ProcessingMode.RealTimeDetection);

// Manual override
handler.ForceProcessText();

// Reset if things get weird
handler.ResetState();
```

## 🎨 Features

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Text not processing?**
- Check if `pauseProcessing` is false

- Try hitting "Force Process Text" button in inspector

**Getting stuck in a loop?**
- Hit the "Reset State" button in inspector
- Check your processing mode settings

**Still having issues?**
- Check the `lastError` field in inspector for clues
- Enable `logErrors` for detailed console messages
